That's an extensive and well-structured plan! Since you're familiar with both **6502** and **Kotlin** and have worked through **Crafting Interpreters** (which is essentially building a compiler/interpreter pipeline), I can simplify these passes by relating them to standard compiler steps and how they'd specifically apply to 6502's quirks.

Here's a simpler, phase-by-phase explanation of what each set of passes is trying to achieve.

***

## Phase 1: Parsing & Initial Analysis

This phase is about taking the raw text of the assembly code and turning it into a clean, address-mapped, and verifiable internal list of instructions.

* **Pass 1: Assembly Parsing:** Think of this as the **Lexer and Parser** from *Crafting Interpreters*. It reads the text line by line and converts strings like `LDA #$05` and `MY_LABEL:` into structured data objects. It also lists all the labels so we know what names mean.
* **Pass 2: Address Resolution:** The 6502 is all about memory. This pass acts like an **Assembler's second pass**. It figures out the exact memory address for *every* instruction and, more importantly, calculates what address a label like `JMP MY_LABEL` actually refers to. It also starts dividing the memory map into "code" and "data."
* **Pass 3: Disassembly Validation:** This is a basic **sanity check**. It makes sure the assembly code isn't gibberish. For example, it checks if `LDA` uses a valid addressing mode like Immediate (`#$05`) and not something wrong for that instruction.

***

## Phase 2: Function & Block Discovery

The 6502 doesn't have a formal `FUNCTION` keyword. This phase is about figuring out where the code starts, where the different routines are, and how they flow into each other.

* **Pass 4 & 5: Entry Point & Reachability Discovery:** These passes find all the starting lines of code. This includes the CPU's **interrupt vectors** (RESET, NMI) and any place a `JSR` (Jump to Subroutine) points to. Then, it follows all the jumps/branches from those points to find all the **executable code** and ignore any data or dead code.
* **Pass 6 & 7: Basic Block & CFG Construction:** This is the core of structural analysis.
    * **Basic Block:** A straight-line sequence of instructions with **one way in** (the first instruction) and **one way out** (the last instruction, usually a jump or branch).
    * **CFG (Control Flow Graph):** A map (graph) where the blocks are the nodes and the jumps/branches/fall-throughs are the arrows (edges). This lets us see the actual flow of control.
* **Pass 8: Function Boundary Detection:** Now that we have the CFG, we group the basic blocks together into proper functions. A function starts at a `JSR` target and typically ends with an `RTS` (Return from Subroutine).

***

## Phase 3: Data Flow Analysis

This phase tracks **values** (numbers, addresses) as they move through the **6502's registers** (A, X, Y) and **memory**.

* **Pass 9: Dominator Tree Construction:** This helps with finding structured code, especially loops. A block **dominates** another if *every* possible path from the function's start to the dominated block *must* pass through the dominator block first.
* **Pass 10 & 11: Liveness & Use-Def Analysis:** These passes track where a value is **defined** (e.g., `LDA #$10`) and where it is **used** (e.g., `STA $0200`). **Liveness** asks: *At this line, will the value in register A be used again before it's overwritten?* This is crucial for correctly tracking variables.
* **Pass 12 & 13: Function I/O & Call Graph:**
    * **Function I/O:** Figures out the **"API"** of a 6502 function: what registers/memory it **reads** when it starts (inputs) and what registers/memory it **changes** when it finishes (outputs/side effects).
    * **Call Graph:** Just a map showing which function calls which other function.

***

## Phase 4: Structural Analysis

We're converting spaghetti-code jumps (`JMP`, `BNE`) into structured Kotlin constructs (`if`/`while`/`for`).

* **Pass 14 & 15: Loop & Conditional Detection:** Uses the CFG and Dominator Tree to spot common patterns:
    * **Loop:** A block that jumps back to a block that **dominates** it (a "back edge").
    * **If/Else:** A conditional branch (`BCC`, `BNE`, etc.) that splits the flow and then the branches rejoin later.
* **Pass 16 & 17: Region Formation & Goto Elimination:** This is the process of building the **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**. It replaces raw instructions and jumps with hierarchical structures like a `WhileLoopRegion` or an `IfElseRegion`. This conversion often eliminates the need for any low-level `goto` statements, which is the goal of a decompiler.

***

## Phase 5: Type & Value Analysis

The 6502 is an untyped 8-bit machine. This phase gives the data **meaning** so it can be converted to typed Kotlin.

* **Pass 18: Constant Propagation:** If you load a constant like `LDA #$05` and never change it, we replace all subsequent uses of "register A" with the constant value `5`.
* **Pass 19 & 20: Memory Access & Type Inference:**
    * **Memory Access:** Tracks if memory is being accessed like an array (`Base Address + Index Register`) or a structure (`Zero Page Pointer Indirection`).
    * **Type Inference:** Guesses the type. If a value is only used in a branch condition (`BNE`), it's probably a **Boolean**. If it's used with `INC` or `DEC`, it's a **Counter/Index**.
* **Pass 21: Stack Frame Analysis:** The 6502 stack is mainly used for **return addresses** and saving registers (`PHA`/`PLA`). This pass figures out if it's also being used to pass function **parameters** or store **local variables**.

***

## Phase 6: Expression Reconstruction

This phase turns multiple 6502 instructions into a single high-level Kotlin expression, like turning $\texttt{LDA X} \to \texttt{ADC Y} \to \texttt{STA Z}$ into $\texttt{Z = X + Y}$.

* **Pass 22: SSA Construction (Optional):** **Static Single Assignment** form. Ensures every variable/register is assigned a value *exactly once* (by giving it a version number, like `A1`, `A2`). This makes the data flow perfectly clear for the next passes.
* **Pass 23: Expression Tree Building:** This is the main work. It groups sequences of instructions that compute a result (`LDA`, `EOR`, `ASL`) and converts them into a tree structure that represents an algebraic or logical expression.
* **Pass 24 & 25: Idiom Recognition & Flag Simplification:**
    * **Idiom:** The 6502 needs many instructions for 16-bit math. This pass recognizes those patterns and replaces them with a single Kotlin operation like `value = value + 1000`.
    * **Flags:** Simplifies flag usage. For example, `CMP #$00` followed by `BNE` is a **"not-zero" check**. We replace that sequence with a simple boolean condition.
* **Pass 26: Common Subexpression Elimination:** Finds where the code calculates the same thing twice (e.g., `A = (X+Y)` and later `Z = (X+Y)`). It calculates it once, stores the result, and reuses it.

***

## Phase 7: Variable & Naming

This phase focuses on making the generated Kotlin readable and maintainable.

* **Pass 27 & 28: Variable Identification & Naming:** Groups all memory accesses that seem to refer to the same logical variable. It uses existing assembly labels, but for non-labeled memory, it generates meaningful names based on inferred type (`index`, `counter`, `pointer`).
* **Pass 29: Parameter Recovery:** Formally labels the inputs identified in Pass 12 as function **parameters** (e.g., `fun myFunc(inputIndex: Int, inputA: UByte)`).

***

## Phase 8: Optimization & Cleanup

The final polish to make the generated Kotlin clean and fast.

* **Pass 30-33: General Optimization:** Standard compiler optimizations: **Dead Code Elimination** (removing code that has no effect), **Copy Propagation** (replacing a variable that's just a copy of another), **Algebraic Simplification** (`X + 0` becomes `X`), and **Control Flow Simplification** (merging blocks that just jump to each other).
* **Pass 34: Variable Lifetime Analysis:** Determines the *scope* of each variable, ensuring it's defined in the narrowest possible scope in the Kotlin code (e.g., inside the loop where it's used, not as a function-wide variable).

***

## Phase 9: Code Generation

The final step where the internal representation (the AST) is turned into text.

* **Pass 35: AST to Kotlin Conversion:** The final **Code Generator**. It walks the structured AST (loops, ifs, expressions) and prints out the corresponding Kotlin syntax.
* **Pass 36 & 37: Comments & Formatting:** Adds the original assembly lines back as comments and applies standard Kotlin formatting rules for a nice-looking output.
* **Pass 38: Final Validation:** Checks that the resulting Kotlin code is syntactically correct and type-safe.

The **Optional Advanced Passes** are just what they sound likeâ€”steps for handling tricky, intentionally complex, or poorly-documented code (e.g., code obfuscation or lack of external docs).
